/**
 * This is an attempt at an alternative to DList, to provide an immutable list with
 * efficient cons and snoc.
 *
 * The structure operates similar to DList, but rather then store each difference
 * on the stack we utilise a cons list to store all functions. In order to maintain
 * efficient snoc we maintain two lists of changes, appends and prepends.
 *
 * How it works:
 *
 * A traditional DList is able to perform each difference function on the seed in turn. As the last
 * change sits at the top of the stack, it has access to the seed first, this aspect is what allows
 * both efficient cons and snoc, the last difference can either choose to act on the seed for snoc,
 * or delegate to the next change and act on the response for cons. This process comes at a cost,
 * of each operation chewing through a stack frame. In scala (or rather on the JVM) this cost makes
 * DList infeasible - afaik.
 *
 * This structure stores a list of differences, as a function of List[A] => List[A],
 * the eventual evaluation takes a seed list, and applys each difference in turn. In effect we have
 * moved the size cost from the stack to memory where the list of functions is stored. The naive
 * implementation (storing a single list of differences) means we can have efficient snoc with no
 * stack overhead, but cons either has the same stack issue or loses its efficiency.
 *
 * To solve for both snoc and cons, we utilise two lists: a list for differences that (for efficient
 * operation) require application after the current set of differences have been applied - referred
 * to as 'post' operations, an example of which is cons; and a list for differences that (again
 * for efficient operation) require application before the current set of differences have been
 * applied - referred to as 'pre' operations, an example of which is snoc.
 *
 * This structure does have a cost over and above that of a standard DList for prepending another
 * Dequeue. This structure requires 2 ':::' list prepend operations, where DList only requires a
 * single ':::'. This does not significantly add to the algorithmic complexity, but it is still
 * less then desirable. There is a possible solution by modifying the core structure to be a list of
 * pre/post pairs, i.e.  List[(List[A] => List[A], List[A] => List[A])], this would allow nesting
 * to be achieved without the additional overhead, but requires more investigation.
 *
 *
 * Examples for my own sanity:
 *
 *

 *
 *  Other alternatives -
 *
 *  I have been thinking of further alternatives, but at this stage they are just random
 *  thoughts. One I will pursue further is to introduce a more sophisticated structure
 *  to represent differences. By using a ADT that encodes each optimisation we may be able to
 *  store a single list of differences and implement the fold of the final list of changes with
 *  a delay queue, so each 'difference' can say, execute now or delay until later.
